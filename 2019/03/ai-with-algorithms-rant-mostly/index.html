How yr&rsquo; been.</p></blockquote><h2 id=what-is-going-on>what is going on.</h2><p>i have never thought of me doing this in my life, but this situation has come, so in the past month i have been trying to post and update whats been going on. But i am unable to complete what i started and it is bothering me still now, after that happened i stumbled upon an another old project of mine, which i cleaned up and finished it in a short span and btw this is the project that i am talking about that i didn&rsquo;t complete.</p><h2 id=what-happened>what happened.</h2><p>So it&rsquo;s been a tough tight scheduled week. I was juggling with a lot of things, so this event came up &lsquo;do something with ai&rsquo;,  this is a willingness event, which means I can choose if I wanted to join (which didn&rsquo;t happen by the way), So keeping in mind that I was already involved in soo much things, it was definitely overwhelming from my end,  considering that I had set my goals to finishing a book, complete a personal project,  and I was already dealing with personal problems and I had no interest in ai, this was not the call for me, So I was forced to join by my peers, so I had to do my best, at least for my satisfaction. I was entering into the territory of ai, so the problem statement is not chosen by me, I was told to implement someone else cooked up, I didn&rsquo;t knew that would not work at that time, looking back now, I was blinded by simplified self. So the brain washing part comes along, where my subconscious was dragged by manipulation and imagination that I didn&rsquo;t need, its a long chain of manipulation from the top,  Damn how did I fell for that, looking back I fell for most things..stupid things..things that are not decided by me.</p><blockquote><p>Enough of this rant, I had to do this for the sake of my future self.</p></blockquote><h2 id=the-disaster>The Disaster</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s get technical here shall we, but before that let me get this straight, I&rsquo;m new to this and basically a starter. So everything that I do from here will be available on my github page, for my little project of mine, I have to predict the next date and the date must corelate to some predefined value, on this date calculated from now I will eat vanilla icecream. This is a pretty damn challenge. So my first approach os going about this with neural networks, since it&rsquo;s the new tech and predicting the date is not easy. So after a while, I finished a working model and was told that I could not do this.. it was too big and I was launched at by a data scientist guy..(getting personal here)..looking back, why did I even bother acknowledging him you know? Why?.  I never learn from my mistakes, so I decided to go with the algorithm part as their suggestions, I mean it was hard.. dragging myself over something (choosing a different path from neural networks). I&rsquo;ll cover two parts one for neural networks and the other for algorithms, so for the neural networks part,  i decided to predict using images, so  i have an eye open for tensorflow, what could be fun? predicting captcha from websites seems like a great idea, plus i have already seen something similar but haven&rsquo;t got the time to try it out, so i&rsquo;ve searched for captcha image dataset and found several captcha datasets from kaggle, so i went and downloaded from kaggle,</p><h2 id=moved-on-not-my-cup-of-tea>Moved on - Not my cup of tea?</h2><p>This post is taking a long amount of time im going to post the source from bitbucket here, the main reason being i dont want to rant and bitch about something and gradually lost interest from working on this and i started working on an old project of mine that i undertook which i am going to post in the upcomming days, this post took a long amount of time that i did not expect, but it&rsquo;s fine nevertheless, im just going up the stairs step by step that i what i say to myself.,, darn</p><h3 id=repo-link-https-bitbucket-org-bluepie-guessing-captcha-with-ai-src-master-here-we-go><a href=https://bitbucket.org/Bluepie/guessing-captcha-with-ai./src/master/ rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>repo link</a> here we go!,</h3></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span>Author:</span>

I should have cleaned everything in the morning.

Next time when I make a post it will be on a new laptop.</em></strong></p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=goal>Goal</h2><p>I have been away from reversing, ctf and modding, basically my hobbies from my University days. but occasionally I do some reversing and CTF&rsquo;s, <em>because of course I don&rsquo;t want to forget everything.</em> I was busy with my office work but in the back of my mind there was always thoughts about reversing apps again usually to find bugs and exploit in myself for fun. That is the GOAL!.</p><h2 id=motivaation>Motivaation</h2><p>The next thing that Lead me to writing this post is that I use torrents sometimes and i mostly do it in my phone. Out of all the Torrent clients I used, ttorrent is the best(phone). I use it but not to the point of im going to buy it(the premium app without adds).</p><p>Lately ads are just awefull, full-blown full screen ads with full audio and you cannot even skip the video. So in one weekend I decided to reverse it, because at this point you cannot use it.</p><h3 id=question>Question</h3><p>Why not use mods/cracks from the internet,</p><p>answer: easy, since I&rsquo;m also in the security community I know for a fact that almost every other mod has some Trojan linked with it and the other reason is I am paranoid.</p><hr><h2 id=warning-or-notice-whatever-you-want-to-call-it>WARNING OR NOTICE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT</h2><p>What I am going to share below is purely for myself to remind me(future me) that at some point in life I did this and is purely for learning purposes for anyone else that might stumbled upon this.</p><h2 id=decompiling>Decompiling</h2><h3 id=fun-part>Fun part</h3><p>Note: I have already done this before and I have a personal preference of tools that I use.</p><p>First thing that you need is the decompiler, at the time of writing this post I have seen around 15 or so decompilers online and offline for android ofcourse personally i have been fan of APK tool its just perfect.</p><p><a href=https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>apktool download link</a></p><p>Some of the Honorable mentions</p><ul><li>cfr decompiler</li><li>jd-gui</li><li>jadx</li></ul><h4 id=apktool-usage>Apktool usage</h4><h5 id=its-simple-apktool-d-for-decompile-o-outputdirectory>its simple. apktool d(for decompile) -o(outputdirectory)</h5><pre><code class=language-console>

</code></pre><p>after you decompile the APK. Explore the decompiled folder for some time.
If you want to to change the app flow or know its secrets, you have to to change those files so you need a text editor with find in files feature. My personal preference for this is Sublime course you can use anything you like.</p><p>So Android apps are basically written in Java and kotlin from native app standpoint. So the files that you saw in those folders are just the compiled versions of the source. For seeing the source code of apps, you cannot see the exact source code from Java everything will be obfuscated and a lot of it will not make any sense to you if you don&rsquo;t have any experience at first so don&rsquo;t be afraid of it. Be very vigilant here I am talking about two things one is the Java source files and the other is the compiled .smali files.</p><p><em>.smali modifications are the most imporatant one, that matters in this post. since that will be used to change the app flow.</em></p><hr><h2 id=modding>Modding</h2><h3 id=smali-modifications>smali modifications</h3><p>This is the tough spot. I have previous experience with assembly(x86 and dex) but for other people you have to learn to understand it.</p><h4 id=viewing-logic-and-instructions>viewing logic and instructions</h4><p>personally, i use jadx for viewing the java code(obfuscated and confusing) and viewing the smali code at the same time and make changes with text editors on .smali files.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/skylot/jadx rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>jadx link</a></p><p><strong><em>for smali modifications to understand the instructions.i&rsquo;ve found this to be useful than the google one.</em></strong></p><p><a href=http://pallergabor.uw.hu/androidblog/dalvik_opcodes.html rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>dalvik_opcodes</a></p><h3 id=understanding-structure-and-finding-things-to-be-changed-to-suit-our-needs>Understanding structure and finding things to be changed to suit our needs</h3><p>So with the command form the apktool part, you would have decompiled the apk, with the help of tools provided above you can also now just view the source and hopefully understand the logic. I am going to tell what i changed after analysing it.</p><p>hint: ttorrent lite can be converted to premium if you have a code, that might be exploitable.</p><pre><code class=language-text>    .locals 0

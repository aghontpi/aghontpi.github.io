Recently, I asked myself: why not host these services on Google Cloud Run? Cloud Run offers a free tier for the first 2 million requests per month, but if I leave an instance running (with a minimum instance count), it costs around ₹200–₹500 monthly—something I&amp;rsquo;ve paid before.</description></item><item><title>DIY RO - Water Purification</title><link>//bluepie.in/2025/03/diy-water-purification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 22:30:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2025/03/diy-water-purification/</guid><description>Intro The water hardness in my home (Gobi) is around ~600 ppm. In Chennai where I live, it’s around 800 ppm (metro water). Half the people get purified water for their drinking; there is business for those who supply water, while the other half get a water-purification system installed in their homes by a vendor/company that produces it. We can build a DIY homemade purifier. It’s a new challenge, a chance to learn new things, and cheaper than buying ready-made.</description></item><item><title>JWT Authentication with Refresh Tokens in Spring WebFlux</title><link>//bluepie.in/2025/02/jwt-auth/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 16:10:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2025/02/jwt-auth/</guid><description>Introduction Summary: I’m documenting this so that I can refer back to it in the future. Recently, I’ve been working with Spring WebFlux, and although I’ve previously used JWTs, this is my first time writing about them. I often forget the implementation details when switching between languages or frameworks, so I’m recording this while it’s still fresh in my mind.
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a compact way to prove a user’s identity between two parties—usually a browser and your API.</description></item><item><title>Unlimited Photos Storage Without Root - Part 2</title><link>//bluepie.in/2025/01/unlimited-photos-storage-without-root/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 18:11:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2025/01/unlimited-photos-storage-without-root/</guid><description>Overview This post is a continuation of my Rooting My Pixel. Over the past months, I’ve been using my rooted phone to bypass storage limits and enjoy unlimited Google Photos storage. However, using a rooted device isn’t without its challenges—if someone gains physical access to my phone, my data becomes vulnerable. Banking appsa and even general purpose applications refuse to run on rooted devices because they detect system tampering. In some cases, the Play Store won’t allow you to install certain apps at all.</description></item><item><title>Certbot Manual Hook – Automating Wildcard Domain Renewals</title><link>//bluepie.in/2024/12/certbot-manual-hook/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2024 03:02:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2024/12/certbot-manual-hook/</guid><description>Overview Securing my website with HTTPS is crucial, and Certbot makes it straightforward for many domains. However, when it comes to wildcard domains (like *.domain.com), there’s a bit more work involved—particularly if I want to automate renewals.
This post explains how I set up a manual DNS hook for Certbot that integrates with my domain name provider’s API (in this example, GoDaddy), so I no longer have to manually add DNS TXT records every time I need to renew my wildcard certificate.</description></item><item><title>Project IDX: A Look Into Google’s Cloud-Based Development Platform</title><link>//bluepie.in/2024/11/project-idx/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 21:14:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2024/11/project-idx/</guid><description>Introduction I’ve been experimenting with Project IDX lately, and it’s quite an intriguing solution for cloud-based development. In essence, Project IDX gives you an always-available coding environment running on Google Cloud. As long as you keep the instance running and remain active, you effectively have a 24&amp;frasl;7 development machine at your disposal.
I primarily use Project IDX for Java and front-end development on my personal projects. One of the coolest parts of my setup is using it with Samsung DeX.</description></item><item><title>Rooting My Pixel For Unlimited gphotos backup</title><link>//bluepie.in/2024/04/rooting-my-pixel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 03:14:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2024/04/rooting-my-pixel/</guid><description>All the previous android phones I had, I rooted them and used them with a custom ROM that had gphotos mod or used it with gphotos mod, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a pixel for android development as my second device..but all this time, it had stock android and not rooted with no modifications.

I already own a server, I rent out a server for hosting my development activities, so why not use that server as a media server, I don&amp;rsquo;t want it to run just inside the home LAN, I want it to be exposed to the internet, of course with required security measures.</description></item><item><title>Overcoming a limitation in Electron</title><link>//bluepie.in/2023/09/electron-views/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 06:03:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2023/09/electron-views/</guid><description>Hey, what&amp;rsquo;s going on with you, hopefully good things, a small personal update, I think I lost focus on my goals for almost a 1.6 years, right after I joined vz, maybe its beause this is the first ime I ever switched my official day time job, wtf, time..time..time it moves soo fast, nowadays literally everthing takes soo much time in this attention seeking nightmare.. wtf, you can not even ignore most of the things, otherwise you will be an outcast, Something happened and it gave me a wakeup call on why I wanted my life goals on the first place, then I realized, &amp;ldquo;you are the person shaped by your memories, at least your behaviour should reflect it&amp;rdquo;, because If I still had my old memories and experiences I would have not changed courses?</description></item><item><title>Birthday Month 2023, Reflection &amp; Goals</title><link>//bluepie.in/2023/08/birthday-month-reflection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 02:06:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2023/08/birthday-month-reflection/</guid><description>This is personal post, not about tech.. if anyone other than me is reading this.. ignore this if you wanted somehting technical.

Why a custom dns server? All websites/apis are just ip addresses (just numbers).

Fdroid? Fdroid is a free and open source Android application repository. You can use Fdroid via the F-Droid client or the F-Droid website. It is similar to the Google Play Store, but with a few key differences:
is free and open source contains only open source applications is not a commercial service all google play dependencies are stripped out when publishing goes through a series of automated tests &amp;amp; manual reviews before being accepted How do I add a new app to Fdroid?</description></item><item><title>Accuradio, Spotify...etc Adblocker in Kotlin</title><link>//bluepie.in/2021/11/accuradio-spotify-adblocker-in-kotlin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 19:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2021/11/accuradio-spotify-adblocker-in-kotlin/</guid><description>Hello how you been?, hope everything is going well.

So in the recent trend of the modern world, with everyone developing new software and technology and aiming to make the life of mankind easy, There are bunch of people who want to just learn new stuff and constantly do things and move on to the next thing.. i consider myself being in that bunch.. this will matter later. The thing about old projects is that they have an emotional touch with them, the reason why i am stating this is because, i think about the functionalities and often about how this could be implemented with the current knowledge that i have, being the way that I am, I mix real life with the code that i write, often times while i write the documentation, review the code that I wrote, or while making commit i find hints in my code that reflected the current scenario in my life.</description></item><item><title> MVC pattern</title><link>//bluepie.in/2018/09/mvc-pattern/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Sep 2018 01:18:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2018/09/mvc-pattern/</guid><description>Dear Internet I didn&amp;rsquo;t blog for 2 weeks and it feels weird. i promise to write within every two weeks from here on now&amp;hellip; i am terribly sorry!.This post is to clear up the silence that stagnated over the past 2 weeks. sry btw.

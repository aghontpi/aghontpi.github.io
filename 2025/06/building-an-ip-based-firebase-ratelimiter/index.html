No extra services, minimal reads and writes. I was able to implement and deploy to production in one single sitting. I had validated this with ai thinking models to find downsides, so it gave me a motivation to complete it quickly.</p><h2 id=personal-updates>Personal updates</h2><p>Like with tradition, I have the personal updates here, I moved the personal section from top to the end of the post over the years. I wana write/ share soo much more.. remind myself more. Been travelling back and forth from work location &amp; home, Been busy with work a lot, though I shouldn&rsquo;t take it too seriously, but when its a new skill, im all up for it, even if its people or project management, the one thing that pains is that there is a onshore team and sync with them is a pain (currently at the time of writing this you work in VZ), evey week, every months feels like an instant, its monday.. then its already friday, then its friday night start.. then its sunday night again with an instant. Feels like a cycle, The older I get, time does feel to go a lot faster. I even stopped playing the occasional gaming on the side.</p><p>My timer tracking project (didnt make it open source yet) was a lot helpful over the months, but I think im lossing a grip on it, its too micro managementy, everytime I do something, I have to open and start and end it, feels like..its taking lot of time just to do that between each teask. So what I&rsquo;ll do is stop using the time tracking app that I built for 1 or 2 months and see how I fare, If I can still be productive without it and can remeber and complete tasks, then its great..future me how is it going?</p><p>Personally I have commitments now and that too is a time sink, Im not keeping tabs on how much time Im spending, I think to myself on heindsight at the end of the week or during self refelction, small small actions, small pieces of time each day over the week.. adding up.. is a lot of time. but I can&rsquo;t ignore it can I, now I know why my friends&rsquo; changed behaviours is attributed to. Its nobody&rsquo;s fault, thats just life.</p><p>The AI slop is all over the place with the internet, its the worst. Manytimes I wonder.. I think for some/ many tasks, If people didn&rsquo;t just overrely on AI, they can complete the job/ task way faster. Again on some tasks, its way easier with AI and reduces lot of time.</p><p>Another trend Im noticing is, people are too much relient on AI to write a feature in a product or entire codebase/product. When something comes up later on the project, they don&rsquo;t know howt to fix it, I&rsquo;ve seen it inside office projects (migration of entire codebase with AI and the people sturggle later), on the internet and word of mouth. Future me.. how its it going?</p><p>About the thing on may.. I&rsquo;d be lying If I said its good/ going great. It is what it is, Trust on the process, I have to keep doing what I do, keep going, keep moving forward, things will fall in place, For now.. For this moment, I know, I have to make the right decision (Future me remember?) and the right decision I know is to stay without making any rash decisions..me reading..what happpended?..hope I/we are in a better place then..when are you reading this? 20&rsquo;s, 30&rsquo;s, 40&rsquo;s?.</p></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span>Author:</span>

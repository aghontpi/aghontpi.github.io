The anthropomorphic presentation of Slop Generators as &ldquo;agents&rdquo; or &ldquo;assistants&rdquo; is a very deliberate attempt to manufacture consent for their integration into workforces at the expense of human interaction. The implication of some higher degree intelligence or sentience is very much deliberate, and it is very much false.</p><p>Make no mistake, they cannot think. They cannot reason. They cannot take into account context. They don&rsquo;t &ldquo;know&rdquo; things or have a sense of humour or any of the other human-centric qualities bad actors would have you believe of them. Slop Generators are a chain of matrices in a stochastic system. The output of a Slop Generator is nothing more than a statistical calculation, where the next word to be generated is decided by an opaque probabilistic function dependent on previously generated words. This is fundamentally the same mathematics that is used to predict the weather.</p><p>A Slop Generator cannot assess the veracity of its claims, nor can it ever tell you that it simply does not know something. Slop Generators are often confidently incorrect as a result, and require brow-beating to admit a mistake. They are therefore highly inappropriate tools in contexts where truth and correctness are of utmost importance, and when the user is not already highly knowledgeable and confident in the problem area. This presents a bit of an issue for Slop Generators; if the user is already highly knowledgeable and confident in the problem area, then why ask the Slop Generator in the first place?&rdquo;</p><h2 id=coming-to-reality>Coming to reality</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been inspecting UI source code of the websites I visit, also the open source projects I see, I see the source code of them as well, it&rsquo;s easy as of Oct 2025 to identify if it was generated by AI. Unless explicitly told not to generate things with Tailwind, it mostly will be Tailwind with its absurd twisted ways of using it. When you see it, you will know it&rsquo;s not written by a human or even reviewed by a human.</p><p>We have to accept the fact, AI is everywhere, using it is productive, yes, but there has to be some oversight, otherwise.. it gets to the point of no return, when at one point in the future, everything is so convoluted by AI, humans can&rsquo;t jump in between and fix it. I think of it like compilers, before people used to write machine code, then compilers came along and simplified the process of writing code by providing a sort of language that we can use to write the programs and code in. Now will the same happen with AI? Will it become some sort of a compiler for programs? At the current state.. I don&rsquo;t see it happening, but when you describe it, the output it does produce, so it&rsquo;s a compiler?? Weird to think about it.. isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>In news articles I see posts in between embedded in them, those are just random stories that are obviously AI generated.. just inserted so that people fall for it and click them. Next time I see it, I will take a screenshot and put it here.. heck sometimes even the news articles are entirely written by AI, I&rsquo;m not even sure if they are getting reviewed by actual people.</p><h2 id=will-i-use-ai-to-write-this-journal-for-me>Will I use ai to write this journal for me?</h2><p>One thing I&rsquo;m proud of is not using AI to write this blog/journal for me, I think there will be a time where written media, written by individuals will be sought after, because increasingly, the AI generated content is everywhere, eventually it might mimic human writing too. An update, I&rsquo;ve found this after I wrote this: <a href="https://youtu.be/vrTrOCQZoQE?si=ytVmNdmNRWPk6yBx" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>https://youtu.be/vrTrOCQZoQE?si=ytVmNdmNRWPk6yBx</a> (a video from Computerphile mentioning the same)</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking and experimenting with AI. In some posts, I&rsquo;ve used AI to generate featured image for the post, the one at the top, but I stopped and went back to me making one, then used them to check spelling and grammar. I think on 1 or 2 posts I used to change some paragraphs or write a poem which conveys another meaning as well, but that is about it, I stopped writing after I did that, I literally stopped writing for several months after I did that, like I lost motivation.</p><p>I have a friend who uses AI to crank out articles in medium, like importnat things you should know in spring boot, using AI in spring boot, top <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> most useful commands in git..etc and people read and like it too.. like how? U can ask ai the same thing.. but the thing is now AI can crawl things on the web, so its not like articles that people write are going to waste, its read by AI crawlers and given back to the users. Most people have transitionsed to using AI for getting their answer, they dont read blog/ go to forums anymore, unless its a specific niche or they have time to do the research, asking ai is faster and its giving an easy way out, and people&rsquo;s brain will subconsioursly/ consiously choose the lazy route.</p><h2 id=identifying-if-its-ai>Identifying if its AI</h2><p>One thing I&rsquo;ve found is that, if you inspect the source code of the applications, it can be easily identified that it&rsquo;s AI, take Tailwind, at least till now, if you see some Cthulhu level sh** in your UI logic in Tailwind, it&rsquo;s probably AI generated. I&rsquo;m glad that I graduated just before the cusp of AI, enough to know what it&rsquo;s like before AI and after AI, I have git commits and open source projects to prove!</p><h2 id=personal-update>Personal Update</h2><p>You are just a row in an Excel sheet, I read this so long ago from Hacker News, since then I&rsquo;ve read countless articles from Hacker News and elsewhere.</p><p>That said, the only thing that matters is your integrity, what you feel about it and how you process it and how you justify it.</p><p>That being said, let&rsquo;s end with a less serious note, I got a new monitor setup for my room, tried using 4k with my mac, it was god tier, I had so much space to work with, I got a 55inch mini led 144hz 4k display (monitor, but its a tv at that size), I sit reasonably far from the monitor, Everything is crystal clear, the responsiveness is awesome, you have to switch to pc mode (it has vrr). I loved working on that, when I came back to my chennai setup 27inch monitor, I couldn&rsquo;t adapt to it for a week. I have so much productivity in that. Let me show you. Played some games on 4k, it was really good, if I was a small kid I would literally spend my whole day, but big buddy me, got responsibilities and grownup duties, I played ghost, its one of the best games imo, no comments on the 2nd ghost game though. I bought amazing spider man remake, played for a couple of hours, it was good, need to finish it after I retire? IDK maybe before that..</p><p><figure><img src=//bluepie.in/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src=//bluepie.in/images/posts/oct-2025/my-desk-setup-2025.jpg alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure></p><p>It was day 1 after my new setup, my desk is still a mess</p></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span>Author:</span>

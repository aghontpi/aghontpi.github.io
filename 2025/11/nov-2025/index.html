(which I learnt from my prev company, I learnt a lot from there, when I joined a big company.. it was not the same, enterprise wise its different yea..sure but it has its pros and cons), I move them from project to project. This eliminates it and makes it easier to maintain and view the docs.</p><p>I wanted a minimal CSS utility that provides just basic features to get started quickly without the bloat of larger frameworks.</p><h2 id=what-i-did>What I did</h2><p>Given the background and the context, I was in the process of changing the UI/Frontend of an existing project. I moved all the reset css to a file, then wrote all the utilities to a separate file.</p><p>Then came the idea of publishing the same, so I moved all the scss code from the main project, put it inside a new folder, initialised it with a package config and bundled it with <a href=https://rollupjs.org/ rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>rollup</a>.</p><p>At this current state, I could not make it public because&hellip; first I had to decouple the existing logic from the codebase to the project, then I looked at the docs and with help of ai, wrote helper functions and saw the standard and fixed my implementations and made it ready for publishing.</p><h2 id=how-i-build-them>How I build them</h2><p>It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward, if you look at them.. gosh the tooling came a long way since the <a href=https://gulpjs.com/ rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>gulp js</a> tooling era.</p><pre><code class=language-json>    &quot;clean&quot;: &quot;rimraf dist docs/.vitepress/dist&quot;,

I&rsquo;ve added an example here for <a href=https://react.dev/ rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>react</a>, but it should be the same for vanilla or other frameworks.</p><p><a href=https://bluepie.in/minimal-css-utility/getting-started/scoping.html rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>https://bluepie.in/minimal-css-utility/getting-started/scoping.html</a></p><h2 id=the-docs>The docs</h2><p><a href=https://bluepie.in/minimal-css-utility/ rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>https://bluepie.in/minimal-css-utility/</a></p><p>Since I used <a href=https://vitejs.dev/ rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Vite</a>, I saw the documentation system by them, it was quite nice to navigate through the docs and easy to setup, I find that sometimes I have to navigate to the codebase and look up a particular css class and probably change it, So I put the docs inside the same folder and wrote the generation scripts inside the <a href=https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>package.json</a></p><p>Writing the docs was very fun, Include my css file and use it&hellip; like how a user would. Because of this&hellip; I was able to figure out
multiple wrong implementations, I was using them with wrong implementations all this time everywhere, I didnt realise it was wrong since I was just copying and moving these source files from one place to another.</p><p>check source examples here:

Their problem is still not resolved it&rsquo;s the second half of Nov.. like heck?. the people who were in charge wrote a lame-ass email of the same thing after 1 month of delay, basically they came back after enjoying diwali and holidays, enjoying their leaves, personally I think I thought.. they just didn&rsquo;t want to deal with all this. The managers who were idiotic saying to a person who was in that situation &ldquo;Now you are the one to help us&rdquo;, just after hearing the announcement, the numbness of that lady is outstanding, I hope she gets what she deserves, karma will come back for her. To see they are having the same kind of feeling they put the person within a short span of time was eye opening.</p><p>It&rsquo;s amplified by this month&rsquo;s announcement of VZ, search Vz, Nov, 2025 (me) you will remember and find it in news articles. Do you remember all the people packing? Im sure you do, For me, I was thinking I was doing my job, make progress every day, handling my releases well.</p><p>The ugly of corporate world, a lot of vendors make the company shit, the developers dont know what they are doing, they are just here for the paycheck with the minimal/ no amount of work, there is no engineering happening even in higher and lower levels, seeing all the frenzy when an announcement is made for budget cuts and etc, they started putting effort again.. I was expecting a level of standard and I can&rsquo;t put a single word to explain it.. again going back.. I think its better for me to just be my own boss, I can&rsquo;t expect these people to have the same level of dedication, integrity..etc</p></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span>Author:</span>

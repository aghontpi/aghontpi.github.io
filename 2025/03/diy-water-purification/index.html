If you are working for big corpora, you are just a row in an Excel sheet. The feeling resonates more and more reading trending Hacker News and things that happen around in personal experience. As for me, as always trying to make time for open source and my hobbies… in the increasing midst of responsibilities coming towards me. I also almost got into a marriage arranged by my dad, forced to go see them… the girl &amp; girl’s family like me and are trying to convince me into marriage, my dad doing all his best to set this up, fighting with me, etc. The girl is good too, perfect for family, they are a distant relative, born in 2000… But there are other plans/God has other plans. ~future me reading this… what happened?</p><p>Talked to an old friend; he said he discovered a private office Wi-Fi password written on a note and has been using it secretly. That reminded me of the first time I cracked a WPA endpoint in 2015. It felt great back then. We had BSNL broadband—“unlimited” but stuck at 60 kbps. I used to combine my connection with my neighbor’s Wi-Fi for maximum speeds. Those were fun times; I even made a mod of an application that combined network connections&hellip;Long story short, he reminded me of Wi-Fi hacking. When I got back home to Gobi, I brought out my old Wi-Fi packet-injecting dongle and Linux laptop to chennai. I found a couple of neighbors’ Wi-Fi networks. After shutting down my unreliable Airtel connection in Chennai, I switched to unlimited mobile data (from previous posts), so I decided to use their Wi-Fi (nobody uses wpa3.. even the new routers comes with wpa2, you can easily capture the handshake and crack it.. I used hashcat, its super fast and reliable). While on their network, I logged in to their router, checked their device list, and configured Wi-Fi settings for a longer range on 2.4 GHz by switching between 20 Hz and 40 Hz channels.. Some of the closest Wi-Fi access points are 5 GHz and offers low latency too.. By seeing the device list, I was able to mimic their device name and avoid being caught. For example: “smart-camera.”.. to be fair, I would just use them for internet..nothing more..nothing less.</p></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span>Author:</span>

How can I achieve this? I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned in a previous writing last year.. that I use open api keys. I started using mobile and desktop clients with just the api keys. Couple months ago OpenAI also reduced the pricing of o3 model by 80%, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the ai very actively, trying to burn my credits as soon as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>

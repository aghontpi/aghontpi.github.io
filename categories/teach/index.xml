Recently, I’ve been working with Spring WebFlux, and although I’ve previously used JWTs, this is my first time writing about them. I often forget the implementation details when switching between languages or frameworks, so I’m recording this while it’s still fresh in my mind.
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a compact way to prove a user’s identity between two parties—usually a browser and your API.</description></item><item><title>Unlimited Photos Storage Without Root - Part 2</title><link>//bluepie.in/2025/01/unlimited-photos-storage-without-root/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 18:11:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2025/01/unlimited-photos-storage-without-root/</guid><description>Overview This post is a continuation of my Rooting My Pixel. Over the past months, I’ve been using my rooted phone to bypass storage limits and enjoy unlimited Google Photos storage. However, using a rooted device isn’t without its challenges—if someone gains physical access to my phone, my data becomes vulnerable. Banking appsa and even general purpose applications refuse to run on rooted devices because they detect system tampering. In some cases, the Play Store won’t allow you to install certain apps at all.</description></item><item><title>Rooting My Pixel For Unlimited gphotos backup</title><link>//bluepie.in/2024/04/rooting-my-pixel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 03:14:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2024/04/rooting-my-pixel/</guid><description>All the previous android phones I had, I rooted them and used them with a custom ROM that had gphotos mod or used it with gphotos mod, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a pixel for android development as my second device..but all this time, it had stock android and not rooted with no modifications.
But what do I mean by gphotos mod..? You get unlimited photos and videos backup in Google photos, the mod makes it seem like you&amp;rsquo;re using a pixel device.</description></item><item><title>Modding a macOS App</title><link>//bluepie.in/2022/02/modding-a-macos-app/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2022 19:10:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2022/02/modding-a-macos-app/</guid><description>Intro This post is about reversing.. but for a MACOS binary. Lets drive straight into it.
Modding in macOS is fairly new to me, but a binary is a binary and it can be modded!. I started to daily drive macOS a month or two ago, the why and what&amp;rsquo;s is a whole different story to post about.
Like I have said previously in my other re posts, &amp;ldquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t trust mods from the internet&amp;rdquo; If I can mod it then its fine, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;m paying for it.</description></item><item><title>&#34;F-droid&#34; vs the pain that is &#34;Google PlayStore&#34;</title><link>//bluepie.in/2022/01/publishing-to-fdroid-google-play/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:34:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2022/01/publishing-to-fdroid-google-play/</guid><description>How you doing? hope you are doing well.

I wanted to learn Kotlin for native Android development, I already knew how to do it with java, so the only obstacle for me is learning Kotlin.
Kotlin Kotlin trello board that I used to track progress. After learning the basics for Kotlin, Kotlin koans is a great place for practice (beginner to advanced). Chosing what to do with Kotlin I use Accuradio android app to stream music, but it does not have a paid tear, So the ads are not skippable and there was no existing adblocker that does this(which is a pain).</description></item><item><title>Why I Choose Typescript</title><link>//bluepie.in/2020/10/why-i-choose-typescript/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2020 21:34:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2020/10/why-i-choose-typescript/</guid><description>Hello, we meet again!, how was the week? hope you are well and gud!, This post will be about typescript, I&amp;rsquo;m not explaining what it is, but rather why i choose to use it.

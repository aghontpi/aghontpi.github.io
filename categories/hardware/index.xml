In Chennai where I live, it’s around 800 ppm (metro water). Half the people get purified water for their drinking; there is business for those who supply water, while the other half get a water-purification system installed in their homes by a vendor/company that produces it. We can build a DIY homemade purifier. It’s a new challenge, a chance to learn new things, and cheaper than buying ready-made.</description></item></channel></rss>

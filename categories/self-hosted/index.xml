However, when it comes to wildcard domains (like *.domain.com), there’s a bit more work involved—particularly if I want to automate renewals.
This post explains how I set up a manual DNS hook for Certbot that integrates with my domain name provider’s API (in this example, GoDaddy), so I no longer have to manually add DNS TXT records every time I need to renew my wildcard certificate.</description></item><item><title>How I Set Up Nginx and SSL for My Media Server and Torrent</title><link>//bluepie.in/2023/12/how-i-configure-nginx-for-my-server-and-torrent/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 20:49:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2023/12/how-i-configure-nginx-for-my-server-and-torrent/</guid><description>Context This post is a nginx configurations of my How I replaced Netflix and started using my media server for over 2 years now
config of jellyfin We already run jellyfin inside podman and expose the service on port 8096, so we use nginx to handle requests to domain &amp;lsquo;media.bluepie.in&amp;rsquo;, which connects to jellyfin podman instance.
I point my domain (through domain provider) to the ip address of the server im running my jellyfin instance, then use nginx to serve the requests, the nginx configs are located inside config folders and are included in main file.</description></item><item><title>How I Replaced Netflix and Have Been Using My Media Server for Over 2 Years</title><link>//bluepie.in/2023/11/self-hosted-netflix-replacer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 21:55:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2023/11/self-hosted-netflix-replacer/</guid><description>Feasibility Can I host Netflix on my own? of course yes, many open source software offers similar functionality, you can set it to work only inside your home network or make it available throughout the internet.
I already own a server, I rent out a server for hosting my development activities, so why not use that server as a media server, I don&amp;rsquo;t want it to run just inside the home LAN, I want it to be exposed to the internet, of course with required security measures.</description></item><item><title>Updating Dns Servers for Ads and Tracking Protection in 2023</title><link>//bluepie.in/2023/01/updating-dns-servers-for-ads-and-tracking-protection-in-2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 06:02:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2023/01/updating-dns-servers-for-ads-and-tracking-protection-in-2023/</guid><description>Upgrading PI hole Once every year, I do server maintainence (during Dec-Jan), this year I updated the our dns server from pi-hole to AGH (both are open source projects..) Just wanted to try an alternative, after using it for a while, the UI &amp;amp; Features on AGH is much better than pi-hole.
Why a custom dns server? All websites/apis are just ip addresses (just numbers). Nameservers maintains a mapping of the domain names to the ip addresses, so when we make a request, we get the appropriate ip address.</description></item><item><title>Open Source Dnd Email Editor</title><link>//bluepie.in/2021/10/open-source-dnd-email-editor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 10:48:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2021/10/open-source-dnd-email-editor/</guid><description>I created a drag and drop email editor, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on it for the past month. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun to work on, I completed it for first release, I&amp;rsquo;ll shed some light on the challenges I faced and how I solved them.
Why&amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp; What&amp;rsquo;s why build this?
No free editors/open source editors that does the job,
but why not profit?
Not interested, I believe in Open Source.</description></item><item><title>Custom Dns Server With Adblock</title><link>//bluepie.in/2019/12/custom-dns-server-with-adblock/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2019 14:15:33 +0530</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2019/12/custom-dns-server-with-adblock/</guid><description>hello guys, as of writing this post this is christmas of 2019 (25 dec 2019), gosh time really goes fast!.
